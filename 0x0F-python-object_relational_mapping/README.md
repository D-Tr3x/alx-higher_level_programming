# Python Object Relational Mapping


## Introduction

This project bridges the gap between two powerful technologies: Databases and Python. We will explore two distinct approaches to interact with databases using Python:

### Part 1: MySQLdb
- Connect to a MySQL database using the MySQLdb module
- Execute SQL queries and retrieve results

### Part 2: SQLAlchemy
- Utilize SQLAlchemy, a powerful Object Relational Mapper (ORM)
- Leverage ORM capabilities to interact with databases using Python objects


## Project Overview

In this project, we will gain hands-on experience with two popular Python libraries for database interaction. By the end of this project, we will be able to:
- Connect to a MySQL database using MySQLdb
- Execute SQL queries and retrieve results
- Use SQLAlchemy to interact with databses using Python objects
